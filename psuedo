user login flow between f and b
- register and login both hit b
- f calls loggedin on immediate start to check
- login on f then sends immediate get to loggedin to b
- f stores result of loggedin to context
- all routing based on user level handled by f and context
- b is hit for logout to clear both

begin to build context for f to receive info from b upon successful login
